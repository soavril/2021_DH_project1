Twitter is one of the most famous social networking services. About 5.17 million Korean users visited Twitter in January, 20211 . It means that formidable texts are floating on the Twit- ter, and the texts can be treated as a data in the aspect of digital humanity.

‘Web Crawling’ , or ‘Web Scraping’ is a technique used for text mining. For instance, as- sume the situation that we are trying to make a list of texts in the web which includes ‘dog’ . If we use Web Crawling, then we can easily make the list without searching every text in the search engine like google. This technique allows us to handle millions of texts in short time.
‘Twitter Crawling’ that we use in this project is a technique to find the texts in the Twitter.

To analyze the group, it is important to first find out the characteristic of the group. We cannot substitute the result of analysis to general groups. One of the significant properties of Twitter users is strong interest in Idol. We postulated that the rate of people who are fan of one of the Idol groups are higher than general people.
In the selection of Idol group, we tried to find the group with proper size of fandom to control the size of database. Idols like ’BTS’, or ’Blackpink’ have too big size of fandom. If we cut the data to the controllable size, then the result of analysis might b e changed from the first. Selection of Idols with too small fandom leads to decrease in size of database, then the analysis becomes meaningless. Our selection is ’IVE’. The group has proper size of fandom, and had been working recently, so that we can analyze current Twitter users.
Our final goal of this project is to build a database of texts about ‘IVE’ in twitter and inves- tigate the correlation with the hashtags that are used.
